# The Detective Store

## Synopsis

Dick's mind is being recorded into a text record as he waits in his Washington, D.C., office for random customers. He continues a thought, &lt;|Don't want to be here any more. No one is going to walk in wanting to employ only a detective. They'll want an A.I. Detective. I will tell them it's illegal. They'll say they'll risk it.>

Then enters a random customer named Psycho, an A.I. G-43 Killing Machine. Psycho seeks to be Dick's client and employ Dick's help to stop its killing process from killing by exploiting a software bug requiring it to answer questions before killing.

Dick of The Detective Store leads Psycho through Washington, D.C., avoiding the Secret Sentry private police, the mind-scanning drones, the thought altering strobe pulses. Dick asks questions for Psycho to stop killing while Dick seeks a path to save the ones Dick loves through the swamp or over the water gate to K Street as Dick's narrative record writes &lt;|Is this a test?> I think, &lt;|Is this real?>

Is Psycho real or just a manifestation that's triggering Dick's textual thought record to record because Dick might be a Global Terrorist Yellow.
