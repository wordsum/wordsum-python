basslines and vibrating windows  the taxi driver would be the first to swing a fist red and blue lights flash above taxi driver and leather bikers i lower eyelids over eyes the darkness becomes a red flash the horn stops the screaming stops the red flash fades to darkness i raise eyelids people stand by taxi and look at hands and feet they shake off drone stare they look upon each other the taxi driver looks and leans on the right passenger window talks he opens driver door and gets in taxi the leather bikers look around find bikes grab bike handles and weave the front wheel through the mass
